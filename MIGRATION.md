This document summarizes the changes made to make the habit tracker project independent of Replit.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Removed
- `@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer` - Replit development tools
- `@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal` - Replit error overlay

### 2. Dependencies Added
- `cross-env` - Cross-platform environment variable setting

### 3. Configuration Files Updated

#### package.json
- Changed project name from "rest-express" to "tgatb-habit-tracker"
- Added project description
- Updated scripts to use `cross-env` for cross-platform compatibility
- Removed Replit-specific dependencies

#### vite.config.ts
- Removed Replit plugin imports and usage
- Simplified plugin configuration to only include React plugin
- Removed REPL_ID environment variable checks

#### server/index.ts
- Changed server binding from `0.0.0.0` to `localhost` for better Windows compatibility
- Updated host configuration to be more flexible
- Removed Replit-specific port comments

### 4. Files Removed
- `.replit` - Replit configuration file
- `replit.md` - Replit documentation

### 5. Files Updated
- `client/index.html` - Removed Replit development banner script
- `README.md` - Completely rewritten with comprehensive setup instructions
- `SETUP.md` - Updated with local development setup guide

### 6. Files Added
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `MIGRATION.md` - This documentation file

## Environment Setup

The project now requires a `.env` file with:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 5000)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment mode
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Session encryption key

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Copy environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
3. Configure database connection in `.env`
4. Push database schema: `npm run db:push`
5. Start development server: `npm run dev`

## Deployment Options

The project is now platform-agnostic and can be deployed to:
- Vercel (recommended for full-stack)
- Railway (with PostgreSQL)
- Netlify (with serverless functions)
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- Heroku
- AWS (Elastic Beanstalk + RDS)
- Any VPS with Node.js and PostgreSQL

## Benefits of Independence

1. **Platform Flexibility**: Can be deployed anywhere Node.js is supported
2. **Local Development**: Full development environment on any machine
3. **No Vendor Lock-in**: Not tied to Replit's infrastructure
4. **Performance**: Can optimize for specific deployment targets
5. **Scalability**: Can scale independently on cloud platforms
6. **Team Collaboration**: Developers can work with their preferred tools

## Next Steps

1. Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions recommended)
2. Configure production environment variables
3. Set up monitoring and logging
4. Consider adding Docker configuration for containerized deployment
5. Add automated testing setup
