# File Naming Convention Update

## ✅ Fixed Non-Standard File Naming

### Problem
The project contained files with square brackets `[]` in their names, which are:
- Not considered best practice for general file naming
- Can cause issues in various development environments
- May conflict with file system limitations
- Harder to work with in command line tools

### Files Renamed

#### Before (Problematic Names)
```
api/[...path].ts         → Catch-all handler with brackets
api/habits/[id].ts       → Dynamic route with brackets  
api/habits/[id]/logs.ts  → Nested dynamic route
api/habits/[id]/track.ts → Nested dynamic route
```

#### After (Clean Names)
```
api/api-handler.ts       → Main API handler
api/habit-delete.ts      → Habit deletion endpoint
api/habit-logs.ts        → Habit logs endpoint
api/habit-track.ts       → Habit tracking endpoint
api/habits.ts            → Habits CRUD operations
api/settings.ts          → Settings operations
api/_utils.ts            → Shared utilities
```

### Improvements Made

#### 1. **Better File Organization**
- Each endpoint has its own clearly named file
- No special characters in filenames
- Consistent naming convention using kebab-case
- Self-documenting filenames

#### 2. **Enhanced Maintainability**
- Easier to locate specific functionality
- Better code editor support
- Improved file system compatibility
- Cleaner project structure

#### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- Works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- No issues with command line tools
- Better Git compatibility
- Easier deployment across different platforms

#### 4. **Developer Experience**
- Files are easier to reference in documentation
- Better autocomplete in IDEs
- Cleaner import statements
- More intuitive project navigation

### API Structure

The new API structure is organized as follows:

```
api/
├── api-handler.ts       # Main Vercel serverless handler
├── habits.ts           # GET /api/habits, POST /api/habits
├── habit-delete.ts     # DELETE /api/habits/:id
├── habit-logs.ts       # GET /api/habits/:id/logs
├── habit-track.ts      # POST /api/habits/:id/track
├── settings.ts         # GET/PUT /api/settings
└── _utils.ts          # Shared utilities and helpers
```

### Configuration Updates

#### Updated `vercel.json`
- Points to `api-handler.ts` as the main function
- Simplified routing configuration
- Better serverless function organization

#### No Breaking Changes
- All API endpoints continue to work exactly the same
- Frontend code requires no changes
- Database operations unchanged
- Same URL structure maintained

### Testing Results

#### ✅ Verified Functionality
- Development server starts successfully
- All API endpoints respond correctly
- TypeScript compilation passes
- Build process completes without errors
- Frontend application loads properly

#### ✅ API Endpoints Working
- `GET /api/habits` - Returns habit list
- `POST /api/habits` - Creates new habits
- `DELETE /api/habits/:id` - Deletes habits
- `GET /api/habits/:id/logs` - Returns habit logs
- `POST /api/habits/:id/track` - Tracks habit completion
- `GET /api/settings` - Returns user settings
- `PUT /api/settings` - Updates user settings

### Benefits

1. **Professional Standards**: Follows industry best practices for file naming
2. **Better Tooling Support**: Works seamlessly with all development tools
3. **Cross-Platform**: No file system compatibility issues
4. **Maintainable**: Easier for teams to understand and navigate
5. **Future-Proof**: Won't cause issues as the project grows

### Migration Complete

The file naming has been successfully updated without any breaking changes. The project now uses clean, professional file naming conventions while maintaining all existing functionality.
