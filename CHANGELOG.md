# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 0.2.2 - 2025-08-09

Focused Android system bar stabilization and CI workflow corrections.

### Changes

- Added `SystemBarInit` root component with multi-pass (timed) enforcement of purple (`#6750a4`) status & navigation bar colors plus white icons to eliminate white-on-white race on cold start.
- Updated Capacitor `StatusBar` plugin config (`style: "light"`) to force white icons over brand purple.
- Re-enabled legacy `useSystemBars` hook on home page for redundant safety until fully confident native + init component cover all lifecycle paths.
- Ensured root layout imports `SystemBarInit` so it runs before most UI paints.

### CI / Workflow

- Preparing GitHub Actions fix for Android release job failures (investigating missing sync / build step nuances); version bump to `0.2.2` for next tag once workflow passes.

### Pending / Next

- If emulator still shows dark icons on white at launch, next step: move color & icon enforcement into native `onCreate` before splash and double-check splash theme status bar icon contrast flags.
- Potential optimization: remove redundant JS enforcement after confirmed stable behavior across resume / orientation / keyboard.

## 0.2.1 - 2025-08-09

Android system bar theming groundwork and minor native tweaks.

### Added / Changed

- Android: Explicit purple (`#6750a4`) system bar colors (status & navigation) defined in native styles; removed translucent flags that caused white fallback.
- Added `navigation_bar_color` resource; launch (splash) theme now sets both bar colors to avoid white flash on startup.
- WebView background set to purple to ensure any transient transparency remains on-brand.
- SystemUi plugin already re-applies purple + white icons on focus/resume; left logic in place for future refinements.

### Deferred / Known Issue

- Emulator (Android 16 preview image) still shows white/gesture area background due to gesture navigation pill area not adopting app navigation bar color under current edge-to-edge configuration. Further investigation (likely involving insets + disabling enforced gesture nav contrast) deferred to a later patch.

### Next

- Revisit navigation gesture pill background & immersive edge in a focused follow-up (0.2.2) with optional fallback to solid 3â€‘button bar styling.

## 0.2.0 - 2025-08-08

Major update with platform persistence, Android build fixes, and UX improvements:

- Settings persistence: unified, async storage using Capacitor Preferences on native and localStorage on web; saves fullscreen immediately.
- Back navigation: standardized Android behavior with overlay-aware closing and "press back again to exit" on Home.
- Overlay management: centralized modals (drawer, dialogs) with priorities; consistent close logic.
- Replace deprecated @capacitor/storage with @capacitor/preferences; synced native plugins.
- Android build: enforce Java 21 source/target; remove OS-specific gradle JDK path; cross-platform guidance.
- Lint/Type: resolved all ESLint errors and tightened types across components and libs.
- Minor cleanups in PWA install prompt, service worker registration, offline toast, and utilities.

Note: Version 0.1.2 was not officially released. The planned changes for 0.1.2 were consolidated into 0.2.0.

## 0.1.1 - 2025-08-08

- System bar improvements: respected OS navigation bar visibility and refined StatusBar styling.
- Polished Android theming behavior for better consistency.

## 0.1.0 - 2025-08-08

- Initial release.
- Android: edge-to-edge support and navigation bar management to enhance theme responsiveness.
